- Feature engineering  
- Trained ML models using scikit-learn  
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall  
- Visualization of important features  

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📊 Dataset
Public heart disease dataset (e.g., UCI Heart Disease dataset)

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
jupyter notebook Heart_Disease_prediction_.ipynb
